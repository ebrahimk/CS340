# Typetester Web App

This repository contains all of the source code for a type testing web application originally developed by a fellow Oregon Stater, Joseph Kirkpatrick
His application was revamped for the final cumulative group project for CS340 Databases.

## Project Additions for Databases Final Project

The final project for CS340 required that class groups of two submit a web application available on the local Oregon State Network.
As a group myself and Joseph Kirkpatrick made substantial improvements to the web application. The final project submission contained the following features:

1. MySQL relational database engine for keeping track of user profiles, logins, test results, words, and top_misspelled words
2. CI/CD build and release in Azure DevOps
3. Both the Node.js web application and MySQL databases were deployed to Azure cloud services
